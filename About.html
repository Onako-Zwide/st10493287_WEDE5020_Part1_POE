    <h2>Our Background</h2>
    <p>FreshMart ORGANICS was founded in 2017 by visionary entrepreneurs Onako Zwide and Alizwa Tshantshi, who shared a deep passion for health, sustainability, and community empowerment. 
      The journey began on a modest farm nestled in the heart of Makhanda, where the founders cultivated organic produce using eco-conscious methods and a commitment to chemical-free farming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Recognizing the growing demand for wholesome, natural foods, they launched a small stall at the local farmer’s market. Their dedication to quality and transparency quickly earned them a loyal following. 
      Customers appreciated not only the freshness of the products but also the values behind them—supporting local agriculture, reducing environmental impact, and promoting wellness.
    </p>
    <p>
      As word spread, FreshMart ORGANICS evolved from a humble stall into a trusted retail brand. Today, it offers a wide range of organic fruits, vegetables, dairy alternatives, skincare items, and eco-friendly household products. 
      The founders’ original mission remains at the heart of the business: to ensure that every South African has access to healthy, organic foods and sustainable products that nourish both body and planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      FreshMart ORGANICS continues to grow, driven by a commitment to ethical sourcing, community partnerships, and innovation in organic retail. From farm to shelf, every product tells a story of care, integrity, and a greener future.
